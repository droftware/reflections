When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    If many people are working on a project then we would like to have a remote
    repository to which all the people developing can push and pull their changes 
	to so as to have the entire project development in a single place.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Suppose we have pulled from the remote and have comitted a few changes on our 
    local version.Meanwhile the remote has changed since other people have pushed their
    changes.In such a case we dont want our version to be disturbed by changes unless we
    have made our changes fully. 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork is a github feature in which a public repository can be copied to our account so 
    that we can modify/add the code to our liking.Forking a repository also links to the original
    repository giving the original author credit,also we can easily make pull requests to the 
    original repository of an additional feature which we have developed and want to incorporate
    in the original repository.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
