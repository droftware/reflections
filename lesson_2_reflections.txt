What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When we initialize a repository a hidden directory by the name of git is created 
	which will be used to store the metadata about different version of the directory.
	We need it so that different versions of the directory can be trackked by git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized? How would branches help?

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in
the diagram the way we do?

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?

NOTES

git status shows which files have been changed since last commit.

HEAD is gits name for current commit 

from notes
You are in 'detached HEAD' state 
HEAD is what Git calls the commit you are currently on. You can “detach” the HEAD by switching to a previous commit, which we’ll see in the next video. Despite what it sounds like, it’s actually not a bad thing to detach the HEAD. Git just warns you so that you’ll realize you’re doing it.
